    Noise-generator Synth

    Purpose:
    This web application creates a noise-generator synthesizer using the Tone.js library. 
    The synthesizer is designed to generate random melodies in four different pitch ranges (low, mid-low, mid-high, and high) in response to MIDI keyboard input. 
    It incorporates various audio effects such as FeedbackDelay, Freeverb, Distortion, and a Low-Pass Filter to shape the sound.

    How to Run:
    1. Open this HTML file in a web browser.
    2. Make sure to start the "AudioContext" by clicking the "Start AudioContext" button.
    3. Use a MIDI keyboard to play notes (C3, D3, E3, F3) to activate loops in different pitch ranges.
    4. Adjust the synth's volume and cutoff frequency using the respective sliders.
    5. Pause the synth with the "Stop" button.
    6. Open the developer tools to check if WebMidi and the AudioContext are enabled.
